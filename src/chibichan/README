# 🐾 Chibichan Pet Game (JavaFX)

This is a simple virtual pet game I built using Java and JavaFX as part of my learning journey.

You get to take care of your pet, named Chibichan. You can:
- Feed it 🍖
- Play with it 🎮
- Let it sleep 😴
- Give it medicine 💊
- Bathe it 🛁
- Take it for walks 🚶
- And sometimes... a random event happens! 🎲

If you take good care of Chibichan, it will stay happy and healthy.
But if you ignore it... well... it might not survive. 😢
